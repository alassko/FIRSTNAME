# FIRSTNAME
This Terraform code sets up an EC2 instance with a security group allowing inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). It installs Apache HTTP server and serves the specified HTML content. The code also includes a listener rule to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Please note that you'll need to replace placeholder values like your_key_pair_name with actual values, and also adjust configurations as per your requirements and environment. Additionally, automated tests can be implemented using various tools and frameworks like Selenium, Jest, or even shell scripts to validate the correctness of the server configuration.

Let's walk through the provided Terraform code step by step and discuss the thought process behind each component:

Provider Configuration:

The provider block specifies the AWS region where the resources will be deployed. In this case, it's set to "us-east-1", but you can change it to your desired region.
EC2 Instance (web_server):

This resource block defines an EC2 instance using the specified Amazon Linux 2 AMI and a t2.micro instance type. You can adjust these settings based on your requirements.
The user_data section contains a bash script that is executed when the instance is launched. This script installs Apache HTTP server and serves the specified HTML content.
Security Group (web_server_sg):

This resource block defines a security group that allows inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
It also allows all outbound traffic.
Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:

This resource block defines a listener rule for an AWS Load Balancer (ALB) to redirect incoming HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
The rule redirects HTTP requests to port 443 (HTTPS) with a 301 status code (permanent redirect).
It's conditioned to apply the redirect only for requests with a specific host header value (e.g., "example.com"). You should replace this with your actual domain name.
Automated Testing:

The comment mentions that automated tests can be implemented using external tools such as Selenium or by invoking HTTP requests to verify the content and behavior of the server.
This part is not implemented in the provided Terraform code but should be added separately as part of your deployment pipeline.
Monitoring and Scaling:

To monitor and scale this application, we can use various AWS services:

Monitoring:

Utilize Amazon CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, etc.
Set up CloudWatch Alarms to alert on specific thresholds, such as high CPU utilization or low available disk space.
Enable detailed monitoring for the load balancer to track request counts, latency, and other relevant metrics.
Scaling:

Implement Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on demand. Define scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics to add or remove instances dynamically.
Utilize Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances and improve fault tolerance. ELB automatically scales to handle varying levels of traffic.
Configure the ASG to use a launch configuration or launch template that includes the necessary setup for serving the web application, including installing the web server and deploying the HTML content.
By implementing monitoring and scaling strategies, you can ensure that your application remains responsive, resilient, and cost-effective, even as traffic fluctuates.
