This Terraform code sets up an EC2 instance with a security group allowing inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). It installs Apache HTTP server and serves the specified HTML content. The code also includes a listener rule to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Please note that you'll need to replace placeholder values like your_key_pair_name with actual values, and also adjust configurations as per your requirements and environment. Additionally, automated tests can be implemented using various tools and frameworks like Selenium, Jest, or even shell scripts to validate the correctness of the server configuration.
